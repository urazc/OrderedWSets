This project includes implementations in C++ and R, focused on working with Finite State Machines (FSMs) and generating W-sets — a structure used for state identification and test generation in FSM-based testing. Here's a detailed breakdown of its structure and content:

1.. Source Code Components
 C++ Code:
The C++ source code implements Ordered W-Sets, an algorithm for conformance testing in FSMs.

You can use this code to generate W-sets, compute their construction time and memory usage, and generate test suites based on FSMs.

To compile this code:

Use Visual Studio 2019.

Create a new project and include all source code files and related .txt files in the project folder.

If you encounter build errors or issues compiling, you're instructed to contact Uraz Turker via u.turker@lancaster.ac.uk for help.

R Code:
The R scripts are used to process the output datasets generated by the C++ code.

They likely handle tasks like:

Reading structured benchmark results.

Aggregating metrics such as test suite cost or W-set construction time.

Visualizing the data (e.g., variance plots, comparisons across algorithms or FSMs).

2. FSM Input Format
The FSMs are defined in plain text files with a structured format:

FSM_ID  #_States  #_Transitions  #_Inputs  #_Outputs  Void
initial_state  destination_state  input  output
...
FSM_ID: An integer identifying the FSM.

#_States: Number of states in the FSM.

#_Transitions: Total number of transitions.

#_Inputs / #_Outputs: Number of input and output symbols.

Void: Placeholder — possibly unused or reserved.

Each transition is then defined in the lines that follow:

initial_state → where the transition starts.

destination_state → where the FSM moves to.

input → input symbol that triggers the transition.

output → output symbol produced.

3. Benchmark Statistics Files: FSMsStat and benchFSMsStat
These are tabular files (likely CSV or space-separated), containing performance metrics and FSM parameters. Each row corresponds to a specific FSM.

Columns Explained:
Column	Meaning
FSM_ID	Unique identifier for the FSM.
FSMStates	Number of states in the FSM.
FSMInputs	Number of distinct inputs the FSM can receive.
FSMOutputs	Number of outputs the FSM can produce.
FSMSize	Total number of transitions (i.e., edges in the FSM graph).
W_Time	Time (in ms) taken to construct the W-set.
W_Memory	Memory (in MB) used during W-set construction.
SIS_Tr	Number of inputs used for transfers during state identification.
SIS_Size	Total number of distinct sequences used for state identification.
SIS_Cost	Total number of inputs across all state identification sequences.
TS_Size	Number of sequences in the final test suite.
TS_Cost	Total number of inputs across the entire test suite.
Algorithm	Name of the algorithm used (e.g., OWA,CWA,MWA).


4. File Mapping: fileBindings.txt
This file maps FSM file names (like bbara_minimized.dot) to their corresponding FSM_IDs used in the statistical summary files (e.g., benchFSMsStat.txt).

For example:

If FSM_ID = 0, the corresponding file is bbara_minimized.dot.

This is useful for linking raw FSM definitions to summarized performance metrics.

How to Compile and Use
Set up Visual Studio 2019:

Create a project.

Include all C++ source files and .txt input/output files.

Compile the code.

Run the code to process FSMs and generate W-sets, test suites, and stats.

Use the R scripts to read the output stats files and generate analyses or plots.

Map FSMs to IDs using fileBindings.txt when interpreting results.
